# Seed-Based Base Finder (WIP)
A Minecraft mod for Fabric that highlights differences in blocks on a server and the naturally generated world. Needs server seed to work (Recommend SeedCrackerX).
Use `/setseed <seed>` to set the server's seed, `/getseed` to return the seed.
Seeds are stored and loaded on server leave/join.

This mod is very much a work in progress.

List of things to implement:
 - [x] Set/get seed
 - [x] Seed storage
 - [ ] Parallel world generation
 - [ ] World comparison
 - [ ] Comparison rendering
 - [ ] Configuration options
 - [ ] Generation and comparison optimizations
